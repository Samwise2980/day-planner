# Day Planner

# Description
This day planner dynamically changes everytime you load the page to show you the current date. It consists of a 9 to 5 schedule with time slots to enter your personal events that can be saved to view when you come back. Each time slot will change color whether it is in the past, present, or future.

This was a real challenge to try to get this code to be as clean as possible for ease of use.
